# HW 4

Goals:

- Practice with geospatial data

The assignment contain three parts and will rated in `50`, `75` and `100` points depending on a number of completed parts.

## Data

In this assignment we'll work with the same data as in `hw2` with the information about a specific country with its various indicators in different years.

## Part 1

- draw a map in the svg using `geoEquirectangular` projection
- fill the path of the country using a color scale based on chosen indicator
- show a name of the country on mouseover and hide on mouseout

- make a smooth interpolation between the states of a bars when indicator changes
